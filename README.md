# Chaos - yes
#### Visualizations connecting chaos theory, fractals, and  the logistic map!
###### Written by [Jonny Hyman](https://www.jonnyhyman.com), 2020

This code was developed for [this YouTube video from Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk)

This is not a library, but rather a collection of standalone scripts! As such, there is a bit of code duplication between scripts.

# Quick start guide

#### Install these requirements
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (tested on Python 3.6 and Python 3.7, macOS Catalina and Windows 10)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org) package : `pip install numpy`
- [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) package : `pip install numba`

#### Run guide for total beginners
0. Open "Terminal" on macOS & Linux, "Powershell" or "Command Prompt" on Windows
1. Download this repository and unzip it or run `git clone https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Chaos.git`
2. Change directory into the folder where you extracted files `cd ~/route/to/your/folder`
3. Run the program you're interested in, like `python logistic_interactive.py`
4. To make changes to the code, install a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io) and then open the file you want to edit. If this is your first python project, GO FOT IT, but also it might not be the easiest to get your head wrapped around (I use a lot of nuanced python functionality).

#### If you run into problems
0. Google the problem you're running into
1. If it seems to be a problem with **this** code, post in "Issues"

## Logistic Map - Interactive
`python logistic_interactive.py`
![Interactive](https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Chaos/blob/master/images/logistic-interactive.png?raw=true)

#### Additional Requirements
- PyQt5 : `pip install pyqt5`
- PyQtGraph : `pip install pyqtgraph`

This visualization creates a cobweb plot, time series graph, and bifurcation plot for visualizing the logistic map. The font pictured is "Avenir Next" which is licensed as part of macOS. Other OSes will see their default font.

#### Shortcuts:
- Spacebar: play/pause
- Backspace: reset view & animation

## 3D Mandelbrot Set
`python logistic_mandelbrot.py`
![Mandelbrot Set within Logistic Map GIF](https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Chaos/blob/master/images/logistic-mandelbrot.gif?raw=true)

Here we see the Mandelbrot set on the x-y plane, and iterations of the Mandelbrot set in the z axis. This reveals the bifurcation plot beneath the Mandelbrot set!

Final visualization is accomplished by a volume rendering of 1000x1000x1000 voxels, oversampled by 16 to reduce aliasing.

#### Additional Requirements
- [Vispy](http://vispy.org) : `pip install vispy`
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) : `pip install matplotlib`
- [PyOpenGL](https://pypi.org/project/PyOpenGL/) : `pip install pyopengl`
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) if you want to auto-stitch rendered frames to .movs
  - macOS: [Install homebrew](https://brew.sh) then `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Windows: [Install chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) then `choco install ffmpeg`

## Logistic Map Zoom
`python logistic_zoom.py`
![Logistic Map Zoom GIF](https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Chaos/blob/master/images/logistic-zoom.gif?raw=true)

- [Vispy](http://vispy.org) : `pip install vispy`
  - Note: The final version of the visualization used a custom version of Vispy, modified to improve the appearance of axes. I have not released this and don't plan to, but if you really need it please post in Issues a feature request.
